<div class="brinza-task-description">
    <p>You are given an array A of N integers. You can multiply any of its elements by an arbitrary number. The task is
        to make the first element of A positive, the second element equal to 0, the third element negative, the fourth
        equal to 0, the fifth positive and so on. In other words, the signs of consecutive elements should be [+, 0, −,
        0, +, 0, −, ...].</p>
    <p>What is the minimum number of multiplications needed to create such a sequence?</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class Solution {
                public int solution(int[] A); }</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>that, given an array A, returns the minimum number of multiplications needed to create the described sequence, or
        −1 if it is not possible.</p>
    <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
    <p>1. For A = [1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 6], one of the optimal solutions is to multiply 3 by −2, 4 by 0 and 6 by −1. After
        these changes, A will transform to [1, 0, −6, 0, 5, 0, −6]. The signs of the consecutive elements will be [+, 0,
        −, 0, +, 0, −], as required in the task statement. The function should return 3.</p>
    <p>2. For A = [7, 4, −3, 0, −5, 1, 0], it is not possible to convert the last zero into a negative number. The
        function should return −1.</p>
    <p>3. For A = [−5, 0, 3, 0], the function should return 2.</p>
    <p>Assume that:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
            <li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">100</span>];</li>
            <li>each element of array A is an integer within the range [<span class="number">−20</span>..<span
                    class="number">20</span>].</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In your solution, focus on <b><b>correctness</b></b>. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of
        the assessment.</p>
