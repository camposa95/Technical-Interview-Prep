        that, given an array A, returns the minimum number of multiplications needed to create the described sequence, or −1 if it is not possible.

Examples:

For A = [1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 6], one of the optimal solutions is to multiply 3 by −2, 4 by 0 and 6 by −1. After these changes, A will transform to [1, 0, −6, 0, 5, 0, −6]. The signs of the consecutive elements will be [+, 0, −, 0, +, 0, −], as required in the task statement. The function should return 3.

For A = [7, 4, −3, 0, −5, 1, 0], it is not possible to convert the last zero into a negative number. The function should return −1.

For A = [−5, 0, 3, 0], the function should return 2.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−20..20].
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
